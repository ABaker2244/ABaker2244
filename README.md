**Future Full-Stack Engineer | Builder | Curious by Default | Slightly Obsessed with Learning**


I’m a developer who genuinely loves building things—then breaking them, fixing them, and figuring out how to make them better.

I’m graduating **May 2026** with a background in **Computer & Information Technology**, and I’ve already spent a lot of time doing what I enjoy most: designing systems, writing code, deploying infrastructure, and collaborating with people who care about what they’re building.

I don’t just want a job where I write code—I want to **grow into an engineer teams trust**, someone who can learn fast, adapt, and take ownership when things get hard (because they always do).

## ✨ What Drives Me

* Turning messy ideas into clean, working systems
* Learning technologies deeply instead of memorizing surface-level answers
* Building software that is ethical, scalable, and actually useful
* Working with people who challenge me to think bigger

I’m actively exploring **full-time software engineering roles** where curiosity, mentorship, and ownership matter.

## 🧠 How I Build

### Languages & Frameworks

* JavaScript / TypeScript (React, React Native)
* Python (FastAPI, automation, APIs)
* C++, Java, PHP, Perl (academic + applied)
* HTML5 & CSS3 (responsive, accessible UI)

### Backend, Data & APIs

* RESTful API design
* PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, DynamoDB
* Authentication & authorization flows
* Thoughtful data modeling

### Cloud, DevOps & Infrastructure

* AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, CloudFront, IAM, WAF)
* Terraform (modular IaC, multi-environment setups)
* Docker & Docker Compose
* CI/CD pipelines and automation
* DigitalOcean & Linux server management

### Tooling & Design

* Git & GitHub (PRs, reviews, collaboration)
* VS Code, Vim
* Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop
* Writing documentation people actually want to read

## 🚀 Things I’m Proud Of

### 🏗️ Tactical App Store (Enterprise-Style Cloud Platform)

**Full-Stack / Cloud Engineer**

* Designed a secure internal application marketplace with enterprise-scale thinking
* Built AWS infrastructure using Terraform with VPC endpoints, IAM least privilege, and logging
* Developed Lambda APIs and DynamoDB tables for application metadata and access control
* Implemented CloudFront-secured downloads instead of basic S3 links
* Created formal Target State Architecture documentation (yes, the real kind)

This project taught me how **real systems are designed**, not just coded.

### 🌱 Buddi — AI-Powered Habit Tracking App (Capstone)

**Full-Stack Developer**

* Built a React + FastAPI + PostgreSQL application from the ground up
* Dockerized dev and prod environments for consistent deployments
* Implemented authentication, habit analytics, and AI-powered assistance
* Deployed with CI/CD, Nginx, and SSL on a Linux server
* Worked in an Agile team across multiple sprints

Buddi pushed me to think beyond “does it work?” and toward “would someone actually use this?”

### 💡 App Localization Manager (Hack Day Concept)

**Product-Minded Engineer**

* Designed a modern localization management platform
* Balanced technical architecture with usability and scale
* Focused on developer experience and long-term maintainability

---

## 🤝 Leadership & Community

### President — Kutztown Technology Association (KTech)

* Lead campus tech initiatives, speaker events, and career workshops
* Collaborate with students, faculty, and industry professionals
* Mentor peers navigating internships, interviews, and technical growth

This role taught me that **great engineers don’t work in isolation**.

## ⚡ Fun, But Very Real

My favorite t-shirt has a Java `HelloWorld` program on it. It reminds me that even the smallest programs can be the start of something big.
